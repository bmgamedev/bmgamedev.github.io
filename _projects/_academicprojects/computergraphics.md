### Computer Graphics ###

I completed the project as my final coursework piece for my Computer Graphics module. The idea was to combine skills learned in previous weeks (such as lighting, shading, texture mapping) with some new features we've researched and implemented on our own.

I decided to explore:
 * Post-processing colour adjustments - used to adjust hue, brightness, and saturation, as well as inverting the colours and simulation various colour deficiencies
 * Masking - to create a navigable menu explaining all the possible controls for the user
 * Fresnel - imitating a pane of glass. The camera rotates back and forth around 90 degrees to fully demonstrate how the reflection and refraction change based on viewpoint
 * Celshading - looking at a non-photorealistic shading technique
 * Noise textures - using noise textures as a basis for determining what colour is rendered based on the RGB value from the noise texture. I added random colour generation at the press of a button to make them more interesting.
