### Norseman ###

Norseman is an escape-room style game created in a 6-person team for a 20 credit group project.

It is a 2-player cooperative game where one player explores a room looking for clues, and the other player uses a Diary (see above) to help solve puzzles and provide answers to allow the first player to progress within the room.

As the team was predominantly made up of programmers, but required more than just coding, I took on the job of creating the environment - a home office in this case - as an opportunity to work with aspects of Unreal Engine that I hadn't before.

Whilst I sought feedback from my team during development, I took lead on coming up with the look of the home office and making it happen by: finding assets and materials; creating materials; creating decals; implementing lighting. Some assets were created by the team artist as we needed custom models to suit our needs. The rest of the models were license free models sourced online.
