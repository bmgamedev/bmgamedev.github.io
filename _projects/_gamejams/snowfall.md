### snowfall ###

*Mortriden* was a personal challenge designed to encourage me to complete a game within a short time frame, which I believe is an important habit to form for prototyping ideas and learning how to do new things. My main objective was for the game to require multiple attempts to solve. By imposing a time limit, the player is likely to fail on the first attempt and have to recall the location of notes in future plays. This will encourage replay as the user will be confident they can do better next time and ideally, continue playing the game until they succeed.

The player controls Ego, a human revealed to be stuck in a form of Limbo whilst dreaming. To escape, Ego needs to correctly answer 5 riddles scattered throughout the level. The answers are in the form of notes dotted around the level that can be picked up (including some red herrings).

The in-game clock starts at 9pm and the player has until 7am to reach the end of the level (where one in-game minute is the equivalent of one real-time second, giving the player 10 minutes to complete the game) or else it’s game over.

Learning objectives of project:
    * Committing to completing a game in a short time frame
    * Managing multiple items that can be “picked up”
    * Implement a clock/timer
