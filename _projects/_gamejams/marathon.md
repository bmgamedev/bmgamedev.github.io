### marathon ###

*Marathon* was created during the 2018 GGJ.

The player needs to sneak past patrolling guards without being seen in order to find a door keys and escaped to the control tower.

The game consists of three levels, with each level containing more guards who patrol at a faster pace. The player cannot progress to the next level unless they have found the key to the locked door. If the player is seen, they need to restart the whole game.

I hadn't planned to make the game as punishing as it, with players needing to restart the entire game every time they were seen, but ultimately I decided to keep it that way as it was clear at the last Game Jam that people often come back to a game that is particularly challenging as they are determined to beat it.

Designing each level proved to be particularly challenging as I wanted to create a simple line-art design and was not aware of an efficient way to do this at the time of the jam. Since the jam, I've spent time using Unity's 2D tools and would expect to use these in future to dramatically reduce the time taken to craft each level.
