### surf's up ###

*Surfâ€™s Up* was created for the 2017 Global Game Jam. I worked on the project solo as a personal challenge since this was my first game jam.

The player controls a surfer and is required to jump over sharks, duck under birds, and collect all shells, whilst escaping a large wave behind them.

The game consists of three levels, each at a faster speed than the last. The player cannot progress to the next level unless they collect all 13 shells and reach the finish flag. Both criteria must be met or it will trigger the lose condition. If the player is hit by a bird or shark, they are knocked backwards. If they are hit three times in the same level, the lose condition is triggered as the player will be overtaken by the wave.

For greater detail around my approach taken during the jam and what I learned upon completion, please take a look at my blog post from that weekend:

Learning objectives of project:
    * Working within strict time constraints
    * Creating a game that has a constant movement/scrolling element to it
    * Implement a real-time counter UI element (to show how many shells have been collected)
