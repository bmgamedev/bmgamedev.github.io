### Nightmarevania ###
============

Nightmarevania was created as the coursework submission for my Games Engineering module. We were to team up in pairs and come up with our own game concept and then create it in an SFML engine we built in c++. Aside from the SFML and Box2D libraries, everything in this game was programmed by myself and my teammate.

The game itself was inspired by retro, fantasy, and horror games like Castlevania, Metroid, Axiom Verge, Death's Gambit, and Momodora. The story follows the main player, Serah, who wakes up in Limbo unaware of what's going on. A mysterious voice guides her through each level, explaining that she is part of an ancient lineage of guardians who protect the human realm from demons in the Netherworld who want to break through.

The player has to navigate through three main levels:
  * A chase level filled with spikes and platforms
  * A large, confusing section of the castle where the player needs to find three keys
  * A boss fight with a very determined skeleton.

In my free time, I am working on expanding this project with new levels and enhancements.
