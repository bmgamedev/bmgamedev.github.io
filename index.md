Hi :\)
I'm Beck.
I'm a mid-level Java developer, motivated by opportunities to make meaningful positive change through tech.

Since 2021, I've been working in the social care sector, on a large and complex web-app product implementing a microservice architecture. I'm mainly working with Java but with the occasional foray into js and React as needed. Prior to this, I was employed as a University research assistant after graduating, where I built a topic modelling program in Java with a web front-end to accept user input and display a dashboard summarising various metrics from the model output.

Outside of coding, I'm one half of a 2-piece band, and often playing or running D&D. 

I hope to spend more time in 2024 working on smaller personal coding projects to experiment with new and unfamiliar tech stacks, updating this portfolio as I do.
