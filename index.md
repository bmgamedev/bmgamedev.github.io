Hi :\)
I'm Beck - a mid-level Java developer, motivated by opportunities to make meaningful and positive societal change through tech.

Since 2021, I've been working in the social care sector, on a large and complex web-app product implementing a microservice architecture. I predominantly work with Java 8-11 but also with js and React as needed. Before this, I was employed as a University research assistant upon graduating, where I built a topic modelling program in Java with a web front-end to accept user input and display a dashboard summarising various metrics from the model output.

Outside of coding, I'm one half of a 2-piece band, and often playing or running D&D.

I hope to spend more time in 2024 working on smaller personal coding projects to experiment with new and unfamiliar tech stacks, updating this portfolio as I do.
